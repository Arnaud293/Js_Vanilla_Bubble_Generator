# Js_Vanilla_Bubble_Generator

Simple projet of bubbles generator inspired by FromScratch course on Podia.

This project use Javascript Vanilla and the CSS is already done.

How it works ? 

Bubbles are dynamically injected in the DOM in <span>, so a setTimeout is programmed to clean every span at the same time of new bubbles are generated.
So the setTimeout is there to avoid overloading the DOM.
